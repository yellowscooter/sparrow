<div id="b11" class="faq-answer" >
    <span>Q: Where is FriendsOfBooks available?</span><br/>
    A: Currently FriendsOfBooks&#0153; book rental service is available in Delhi NCR region in India. We cover the towns of Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon, Faridabad and Ghaziabad. <br/>
    <a href="#top">back to top</a>
</div>
<div id="b12" class="faq-answer" >
    <span>Q: What if I do not live in Delhi NCR?</span><br/>
    A: Our service is also available to people living outside Delhi / NCR. Here is how it works for our subscribers from other cities.
	<ul>
	  <li> You register and make a list of books you would like to read (your Bookshelf).
	  <li> Since the customer is remote, the only payment method available is Epayment (credit/debit card, net banking)
	  <li> Once we receive the payment, we send out the books via courier (DTDC/Blazeflash etc). It usually takes 2-3 days for the books to reach our subscribers.
	  <li> Once the subscriber has read the books, they courier the books back to us. This step is important, since the responsibility of sending out the courier is with the subscriber. In addition, the cost of the return courier is paid by the subscriber. In our experience, the cost of sending the courier is usually between Rs 50-100, depending on the weight of the books.
	  <li> Upon receipt of books, we send out the next set of books to the subscriber.	
	</ul>
	Because of the geographical distance, some extra effort will be involved on your part for this to work.  It also involves a little bit of extra expense from your end. 
	Having said that, we have subscribers who are willing to make this extra effort in order to get their hands on good books.  <br/>

    reading habits and budget. For a list of available plans, please visit the <a href="<c:url value="/howitworks.htm?tab=3"/>">How it Works</a> page.<br/>
