  	<b>Our mission</b><br>
	To make reading an easier, enjoyable experience for book lovers in India.<br><br>

	<b>Why FriendsOfBooks&#0153;?</b><br>
	"Books are the quietest and most constant of friends..."-Charles W. Eliot<br>
	They are also the perfect antidote to boredom, an elixir for the tired busy soul and the ultimate thrill ride for the imaginative mind. 
	And now these "Friends" are there for you when you need them! Getting a book to read was never easier!<br><br>
 
	Just imagine, no more haggling with second-hand booksellers, no more cramped bookstores with narrow aisles. 
	At www.friendsofbooks.com, you'll have plenty of elbow room when you browse! You can rent books for you and your family in one fell swoop. 
	Whats more, you will be doing your green bit. Leave a smaller carbon footprint by borrowing , not buying books.<br><br>

 

	<b>How does it work?</b><br>
	Here at FriendsOfBooks.com you can browse and choose from our vast collection of books and we will deliver them to your home or office. 
	You can keep the books for as long as you like. 
	When you are done, just let us know by clicking on the "Ready for Pickup" button on our website. 
	We will send the next set of books of your choice and bring back the ones you have read.<br><br>

	<b>Who are we?</b><br>
	FriendsOfBooks&#0153; was founded by Manish Kumar and Arti Jain.<br><br>
	Manish is a Software Architect who built software in the US for several years, before returning to India. 
	He is an IIT Roorkee and Texas Tech University alumni, who loves to read as much as he loves to code. www.friendsofbooks.com is his labor of love.<br><br>

	Arti  is the final "yea" and "nay" sayer for our collection of books. Even though it is nearly impossible for her to read every book we procure for our collection, 
	it is the excitement of that (im)possibility that keeps her going. Arti has a BA in English from Delhi University, an MA in Mass Communication from Jamia 
	and an MFA in Cinema from San Francisco State University.
	Arti is an independent media professional in her "other" life.<br><br>
